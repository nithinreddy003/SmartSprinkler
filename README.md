# SmartSprinkler
Smart sprinkler system for maintaining moisture in the soil using Machine learning algorithms
The Smart Sprinkler System utilizes machine learning to optimize water usage by forecasting soil moisture levels based on environmental factors. This innovative solution combines temperature, humidity, and other environmental data to help users decide when and how much to water. The system gathers information from various sensors, including soil moisture sensors, temperature, and humidity sensors. A historical dataset is used for machine learning techniques, and supervised learning models like regression and decision trees are employed to determine the relationship between environmental factors and soil moisture levels. The Smart Sprinkler System saves water by only watering when needed, keeps plants healthier, and reduces the need for manual adjustments, making it an eco-friendly and efficient system for homes and farms.
The Smart Sprinkler System enables crop-specific moisture management by creating specific irrigation schedules that are based on the specific wants and needs of each crop. The system's machine learning algorithms can make data-driven irrigation decisions that offer optimum soil moisture levels throughout each crop's growth cycle by taking into consideration the precise moisture requirements of your crops. By giving the plants the appropriate amount of water, maintaining the proper moisture levels increase output and quality while avoiding problems like waterlogging or root rot that can arise from over-irrigating the soil. The Smart Sprinkler System's adaptability across various farms with variable irrigation needs is made possible by its adaptability.
